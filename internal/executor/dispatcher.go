//
// Incident context: nextRetryGeneration (GH-4372) only advances the

// "queued" and "running" both read as a live owner forever. A daemon
// restart that leaves rows claimed-but-queued (e.g. TASK-409's AWS cutover,
// which killed the local process mid-flight) therefore wedges those tasks:
// every future dispatch attempt sees the same non-terminal claim and backs
// off, and the periodic stale sweep only ever looked at "running" rows, so
// it silently reset 0 tasks.
//
// Why this is safe: Dispatcher.Start calls this before adoptQueuedProjects
// creates any worker and before the periodic recovery loop starts — no
// worker exists yet, so no row returned by GetClaimedNonTerminalExecutions
// can have been created by THIS process. Under the single-daemon invariant
// (H7/#4311) every claimed non-terminal row at this point in Start was
// therefore left behind by a prior, now-dead daemon process.
//
// Scoped to CLAIMED rows only (GetClaimedNonTerminalExecutions inner-joins
// execution_claims) — a non-terminal row with no claims entry was never
// inserted through ExecutionLifecycle.Begin, so it cannot be blocking a
// future dispatch attempt via the claim mechanism; GH-3732's queued-project
// restart adoption (adoptQueuedProjects, below) still owns getting such a
// row a worker, unchanged. This is what keeps
