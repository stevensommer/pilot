// Recording that as CommitSHA causes IsTaskShipped to return true on a no-op run,
// triggering pilot-done + issue close with no actual work delivered.
// Skipped for LocalMode tasks (read-only intents have no commit expectation — GH-3642).
// Fails open on check errors (e.g. no origin configured in test repos): only rejects
// when the check conclusively shows the SHA is already on origin/<base>.
// Returns true when the GH-4517 dirty-worktree backstop fired: the ghost SHA
// was rejected, but the worktree still had uncommitted changes, so they were
// auto-committed and pushed to the task branch instead of being silently
// discarded. Callers should record this as a visible execution event — see
