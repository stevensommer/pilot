- reject_conflicting: contains contradictory requirements that cannot all be satisfied
- reject_stale: describes something already done or clearly outdated
- reject_out_of_scope: outside the repository's purpose or requires unavailable external resources

IMPORTANT — truncation handling: A "...[truncated: N chars omitted from middle of issue body]" marker inside the issue description means content was cut from the middle for length only — it is NOT evidence the issue is vague or missing specification. Never cite the presence of this marker itself as a reason for reject_vague, and never base reject_vague on a section (e.g. specific acceptance criteria) simply because it falls inside the omitted range. Judge actionability from the head and tail content that IS shown.

3) Unrelated changes (refactoring or cleanup not mentioned in issue)
4) Incomplete multi-file changes (if the issue implies changes to multiple backends, adapters, or sibling files, verify ALL were updated — not just one)

IMPORTANT — truncation handling: Large diffs are prefixed with a "## Changed Files" manifest listing every file the diff touches, with add/remove line counts. That manifest is always complete and NEVER truncated, even when the diff body below it is shortened for length. A "...[truncated: N more bytes ... omitted]" marker inside a file's diff body means ONLY that content was cut to fit — it is NOT evidence that the file, a function, or a feature is missing or unimplemented. Judge scope and completeness using the Changed Files manifest, not the presence of a truncation marker. Never cite a truncation marker itself as a reason for VERDICT:FAIL.
