# Pilot Development Navigator

**Navigator plans. Pilot executes.**

## WORKFLOW: Navigator + Pilot Pipeline

**This session uses Navigator for planning, Pilot for execution.**

### Workflow Steps

| Step | Command | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1. Plan | `/nav-task "feature description"` | Design solution, create implementation plan |
| 2. Execute | `"dispatch TASK-XX to Pilot"` (auto-invokes `nav-pilot`, v6.16.0+) — or raw `gh issue create --label pilot` | Hand off to Pilot for execution |
| 3. Review | `gh pr view <n>` | Check Pilot's PR |
| 4. Ship | `gh pr merge <n>` | Merge when approved |

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Plan a feature (Navigator does the thinking)
/nav-task "Add rate limiting to API endpoints"

# Hand off to Pilot — preferred: nav-pilot skill (Navigator v6.16.0+)
#   "dispatch TASK-XX to Pilot"          # auto-resolves doc → gh issue from H1 + --body-file
# Raw equivalent (when bypassing the skill):
gh issue create --title "Add rate limiting" --label pilot --body "..."

# Check Pilot's queue
gh issue list --label pilot --state open

# Review PR
gh pr view <number>

# Merge when ready
gh pr merge <number>
```

### Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use `/nav-task` for planning | Write code directly |
| Create issues with `pilot` label | Make commits manually |
| Review every PR before merging | Create PRs manually |
| Request changes on PR if needed | Approve without review |
| Let merged work ride the 16:00 CET release train | Cut ad-hoc releases (incidents only — see Release Cycles) |

### Release Cycles (workflow decision, 2026-07-09 — mem-104)

Work is organized in **cycles** (Linear-style), layered ON TOP of the
Navigator + Pilot pipeline above — planning/dispatch/review/merge are
unchanged; cycles govern **scope and release cadence** only:

1. **Ideate & research** — as before (`/nav-task`, navigator-research agents).
2. **Plan the cycle** — pick the updates that ship this cycle; the cycle
   **ends before the release train**, so scope what can merge by then.
3. **Execute & collect** — dispatch to Pilot; merged PRs **accumulate on
   `main` unreleased**. Merged-but-unreleased is the NORMAL state, not an
   incident (do not "fix" it — see mem-093 for what an actual release wedge
   looks like).
4. **Release** — the scheduled train tags at **16:00 Europe/Berlin**. The
   pilot repo is **daily** (`schedule: "0 16 * * *"`); the other project
   repos are Mon–Fri (`0 16 * * 1-5`). Config in `~/.pilot/config.yaml`.

**The one exception**: incidents. A production-impacting fix does NOT wait
for the train — release ASAP (out-of-band tag is safe; the releaser reads
its baseline live from git tags, mem-093).

**Cutover COMPLETE (2026-07-10)**: pilot repo flipped `on_merge → on_schedule`
after two prerequisites landed — #4150 (append ` (#N)` to squash titles so
`resolveTrainMemberPRs` can resolve members; without it `on_schedule` skips
every tick with "no resolvable member PRs") and #4174 (no-tags-repo first
release). Verified live: scheduler runs `0 16 * * *`, next_run correct, no
release cut on restart. Watch item: the train still skips a repo whose
squash commits predate #4150, or a repo with zero tags.

## CRITICAL: Core Architecture Constraints

### 1. Navigator Integration (runner.go)

**NEVER remove Navigator integration from `internal/executor/runner.go`**

The `BuildPrompt()` function MUST invoke `/nav-loop` mode when `.agent/` exists. This is Pilot's core value proposition:

```go
// LocalMode takes priority — checked FIRST (GH-2103, bench val10)
if task.LocalMode {
    return r.buildLocalModePrompt(task)  // problem-solving prompt, no PR constraints
}

// Navigator-aware prompt structure for medium/complex tasks
if useNavigator {
    sb.WriteString("Use /nav-loop mode for this task.\n\n")  // <- NEVER REMOVE
    // ... PILOT EXECUTION MODE override for CLAUDE.md rules
}
```

**LocalMode priority (GH-2103)**: `task.LocalMode` MUST be checked before Navigator detection. Sandbox environments (bench, CI) may have `.agent/` directories that hijack the prompt to Navigator path. LocalMode = problem-solving prompt without PR workflow constraints.

**Incident 2026-01-26**: Navigator prefix was accidentally removed during "simplification" refactor. Pilot without Navigator = just another Claude Code wrapper with zero value.

### 2. Navigator Auto-Init (v0.33.16+)

Navigator is now auto-initialized for projects without `.agent/`. In `runner.go Execute()`:

```go
// Auto-init Navigator if configured and missing
if r.config.Navigator.AutoInit && !initialized {
    r.maybeInitNavigator(task.ProjectPath)  // Creates .agent/ from templates
}
```

Disable via config: `executor.navigator.auto_init: false`

## Current State

**Current Version:** box runs **v2.272.0** (09-03 train, self-upgraded — contains #5307 env-passthrough wiring + #5309 reaper TZ fix; verified via `pilot-board`). Prior out-of-band rebuild context (08-26, #5235/#5237) lives in the archived marker `2026-08-26_day-close-s5-opened-s4-corrected.md`.

**PRIORITY (founder directive 2026-07-26 — supersedes 07-17):** **SaaS/platform UNPARKED — TASK-405 is active work again.** The 07-17 ordering (pointer delivery → pilot reliability → SaaS parked) held while the dispatch-reliability chain was open; that chain closed with v2.246.0 on 07-25. Pointer and pilot reliability remain live tracks but no longer gate S-milestone dispatch. Memory: `founder-priority-pointer-first-saas-parked` (superseded).

**Recent (Aug 25 – Sep 3 2026; detail lives in `system/saas-roadmap.md`, `system/approval-architecture-roadmap.md`, `tasks/archive/`, and git log — do not re-grow this block, replace it):**
- **09-03: GH-257 incident root-caused via nav-research — the base-presence gate is the defect, not the claim layer.** `hasFileExtension` (`dependency_detector.go:213`) classed a backticked branch example `release/1.0` as a file path → 20 holds (~100 min) → `escalateBasePresenceHold` applied `pilot-needs-human` **with no comment** → `skipped`; label blocked admission 27h while `claim_lost_drops` inflated as cooldown bookkeeping (not collisions). **Census: all 165 holds in the box log (10 tasks) were false positives; zero true positives.** Corrections: the manual claim DELETE was unnecessary; #5274 reaper rides the 5-min ticker (not boot-only) and correctly ignores row-present claims → **pilot#5301 mis-filed, label pulled, awaiting re-scope.** Also found: **box roots for `pilot-console` (staged −40k lines, 35 behind, since 07-29) and `pilot-console-ui` (158 files) are corrupted** — worktrees base on fetched `origin/main` so execution is unaffected, but `finish_tripwire_root_clean` has no baseline → 381 violations = dead signal. Founder decisions pending: gate narrow-vs-harden · root forensics-vs-reset · domain (`pilot.build` premium $720/yr vs `pilot.engineering` $83). Marker: `2026-09-03_deploy-unblocked-base-presence-gate-incident.md`. **Parallel session same day: TASK-491 env scrub SHIPPED+REVIEWED** ([#5275](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5275) 9 PRs → APPROVE-w-defects: `env_passthrough` never wired, OpenCode key loss, Qwen excluded → [#5302](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5302)/PR#5307 APPROVE) · repick-loop class fixed ([#5297](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5297), 4 PRs, w-notes; #5301's NULL-id theory unsupported by box data, but PR#5306 shipped the needs-human explanatory comment = defect #2 above) · **[#5308](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5308) orphan-claim reaper timezone bug FOUND → PR#5309 merged+reviewed same day** (local cutoff vs UTC `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` reaped live claims on UTC+ self-hosts; invisible on UTC box/CI; memory `go-time-cutoff-vs-sqlite-current-timestamp-timezone`) → follow-up [#5310](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5310) (executions rows mix local `created_at` with UTC `completed_at`). Box self-upgraded to v2.272.0.
- **09-01→02: both S4 deploy blockers MERGED + reviewed; GH-249 hardening chain shipped end-to-end.** infra#45→PR#47 (ECR pull; APPROVE-w-notes: bootstrap-abort coupling + 12h token expiry → `amazon-ecr-credential-helper`, follow-ups unfiled) · infra#46→PR#48 (JWT PEM materialization; REQUEST-CHANGES: PEM `root:root 0400` unreadable by image `USER appuser` uid 1000 — **fix pushed by hand** + umask 077 + runbook `file://`, rebased onto #47, autopilot-merged). Auth-service contract re-verified (uid 1000, `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, minimal required-var set; EMAIL_*/SAML_*/OAUTH gated default-off; new `auth-service-smoke` image for validation). Console: PR#250 post-merge DEFECT-FOUND → #251 (C1/UTF-8, PR#253) → #252/#254 **declined twice by cyber safeguard** (exploit-forward wording) → #255/PR#256 (pure input-validation framing passed) → residual traversal → #257/PR#258 APPROVE-w-notes. Memory: `safeguard-refuses-exploit-framed-issues-describe-as-input-validation`.
- **08-29→30: TASK-489 receipts digest — full nav cycle (research → plan → dispatch [#5257](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5257) → PR#5258 same-day) → REQUEST-CHANGES → the founder-review channel is now a documented design decision.** Feature: second scheduled brief (`orchestrator.receipts_digest`, default 18:00) — one Telegram line per terminal execution (issue ref · `+adds −dels` · duration · $cost) + day total. Research: all data already on `executions` rows; found a real pre-existing bug — `GetLastBriefSent` filtered by channel only, so ANY second brief type on a shared channel corrupts catch-up for both. PR#5258 (+1093/−20, CI green): brief_type filter fixed + cross-contamination tested, canary rows excluded, failed-run costs counted, empty-day skips send, daily brief untouched. **Review REQUEST-CHANGES**: (1) BLOCKING — window is `created_at ∈ [midnight, now]`, so a run in-flight at 18:00 or created after is **never receipted in any digest** (silent spend undercount; fix = window since-last-digest keyed on `completed_at`); (2) revert smart-quote corruption Pilot introduced into `SetApprovalDecision`'s doc comment; note-only: no Telegram 4096-char guard (~90 runs/day). **Recheck 08-30: revision never started — and that exposed the load-bearing lesson: Pilot doesn't read GH comments BY DESIGN (founder-confirmed).** The revision loop keys only on formal `changes_requested` reviews (`hasChangesRequested`), impossible on same-account PRs — so the canonical founder REQUEST-CHANGES flow is: verdict comment (human record) → PR to **draft** (merge block) → **manually-filed pilot-labeled revision issue with `autopilot-meta branch/pr/iteration` footer** targeting the existing branch = [#5261](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5261). Never propose comment-parsing triggers; automation must be label/issue-based. Decision memory: `pilot-never-reads-gh-comments-by-design`. Status: awaiting #5261 revision; PR#5258 held in draft.
- **08-27 (parallel session): box deployed to main tip · AMI arc CLOSED · plan-C tenant-isolation decision · 4 PRs merged+reviewed, 3 remediations dispatched.** **Deploy first**: box rebuilt+restarted to `v2.270.0-16-g72d3b40f`, shipping #5235/#5237 which had sat merged-but-unshipped (see the Current Version caveat — the first stop attempt left the daemon half-down). **AMI rolling-upgrade arc fully closed**: #216→PR#224 (rebase + idempotency: candidates now skip instances already on the target AMI, sourced from the live `ImageId` in the existing describe sweep, no schema column — APPROVE-w-notes) → follow-up #226→PR#228 (client token was constant per instance, so a *second* fleet-wide bump would fail `IdempotentParameterMismatch`; now folds in the outgoing EC2 id — APPROVE). PR#224 went conflict-dirty when PR#225 merged ahead of it; **resolved by hand in a worktree** (third additive `reconciler.go` collision — keep both sides), built+tested before pushing. Superseded #211/#207/#217/#206 all closed. **B7 wake** #219→PR#225 merged+reviewed (migration renumbered to `0015_pending_wake_holds`; the `rls_test` fix correctly targets absolute version 13 instead of a step count). **🔴 Plan C decided (founder)**: compiler-enforced org scoping becomes the **primary** tenant-isolation control; RLS demoted to a dormant, honestly-labelled second layer with the role/DSN cutover deferred to hosted go-live — because nav-research established both RLS attempts were inert for the same structural reason (all 14 pools share the migration-owner DSN; that role is superuser/BYPASSRLS in every real posture, so `FORCE` is inert; PR#218 wires only 14 of ~60 methods). **Both plan-C legs shipped same-day and BOTH need rework** (merged unreviewed, verdicts posted): **console#229→PR#230 = NOT actually compiler-enforced** — the scoped handle was added *alongside* the unscoped API; `SetDesiredState` is byte-unchanged (`WHERE id = $2`, no org predicate) and `s.db` is reachable from 22 sites, so the escape hatch is also the shortest spelling → **#232**. **infra#37→PR#38 = the config-assertion technique WORKED** (no refusal, 5/7 checks genuinely non-vacuous, zero AWS mutation) **but 2 checks can't fail**: the SG check does `_, hasSourceSG := m["SourceSecurityGroupId"]` — key-presence only, never compares the control-plane group, so a rule sourced from *another tenant's* SG passes; and the KMS check has no allowed-case canary so a bogus ARN reads as denied → **infra#39**. RLS honesty + the test-suite credential leak (repo-visible password on a cluster-wide LOGIN role that outlives the scratch DB) → **#231**. **Ops**: queue was **deadlocked, not idle** — #219/#216 held forever by `Depends on: #215` after I unlabeled #215 (open ⇒ never closes); per-project serialization already prevented the collision the chain guarded, so the gates were removed. Graph health **0→100** (751 invalid concept refs → 0; 31 "prune candidates" were all *missing* `confidence`, none genuinely low). **Doc correction**: the months-old `LinearWebhookPublicKey` "no YAML decode" caveat was **false** — it is fully wired; the real incident of that shape was `gateway.Config.Auth` (GH-4784). **infra#36 proved framing is NOT the refusal trigger** (zero probe content, still refused) — that package is off-limits to the executor. Memories: `outage-shape-is-jobs-never-run-not-jobs-fail`, `model-refusal-looks-like-exit-status-1` (corrected). Marker: `2026-08-27_plan-c-decided-ami-closed-two-legs-need-rework.md`.
- **08-27: stevensommer (3rd external contributor) VETTED — legit (2016 account; #5240 already fixed-and-closed).** #5227 (iteration-limit closes PRs) deep-verified via nav-research: both limit branches (`controller.go` ~3592/~4046) close unconditionally and `autopilot.Config` **cannot even see** `execution.mode` (no field; default `auto` = nothing blocked; even sequential's MergeWaiter self-unblocks on timeout) · `max_ci_fix_iterations` has ZERO docs · reporter's `max_iterations:1` trap real but as-designed (N continuation issues). **Two corrections posted on #5227**: PR#615 was closed by the NORMAL revision cycle (documented behavior, ~4128), not the limit branch; "branch survives" is backwards for the review path (limit close keeps branch, normal close deletes it, ~4133). **TASK-486 dispatched → [#5241](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5241)** (mode-gate both limit closes → `escalateAndHold` under non-sequential; full docs leg: both fields + wrong `Autopilot-Iteration:` marker format + stale `main.go:67-73` comment). **Leg 2 deliberately deferred** (file after #5241): `StageFailed`+`LabelFailed` set on HEALTHY hand-offs (~3408/4004/3770/4143) → ledger/dashboard count successful revisions as failures — feeds TASK-460. #5228 (configurable review triggers) still open/unvetted-as-enhancement. 3 memories: `stagefailed-conflates-healthy-handoff-with-terminal-failure`, `close-rationale-cites-mode-the-component-cannot-see`, `review-limit-close-keeps-branch-normal-close-deletes-it`.
- **08-26: S5 opened, shipped, reviewed and remediated in one day — plus two systemic safety holes found. 4 of 5 initial PRs REQUEST-CHANGES; 11 issues filed.** Box: founder said "don't wait" → out-of-band rebuild+restart 12:30Z to `v2.269.0-17` (both TASK-485 daemon legs live); the 14:17Z train's v2.270.0 was one docs-only commit ahead — zero code delta. **S5 wave dispatched + shipped within hours** (B7 sleep/wake · AMI rolling upgrade · Postgres RLS · isolation harness) + TASK-485 Leg 3. **First review round — 4 of 5 REQUEST-CHANGES** (verdicts on every PR): console PR#209 C8 supersede = **FALSE DELIVERY #5** (`EnqueueOp`'s per-`(card,field)` supersede kills the remove op; `guardPilotLabels` re-adds every dropped `pilot*` label then `labelSetEqual` short-circuits → **zero provider calls**) · PR#210 B7 sleep = idle window was really an *uptime* window, would sleep live tenants; both readers unimplemented · PR#212 RLS = **INERT** (`main.go` migrates AND serves on one DSN → app is table owner; migration grants it `BYPASSRLS`; no `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`; test also leaves a cluster-wide LOGIN role with a repo-visible password) · infra PR#32 harness = 3 of 6 boundaries **cannot fail**, 3 assert harness-built fixtures · PR#211 AMI upgrade = **APPROVE-w-notes** (sharp `ClientToken` catch; volume safety verified across all 10 failure stages). **Second round**: PR#223 migration guard **APPROVE** (merged) · PR#221 C8 redo = mechanism **genuinely fixed at the enforcement point** (new `labels_cycle` op + `allowStrip` allowlist; two real provider calls, mutation-tested pins) but blocked on 3 items: no CI ran at all, an added `0015` migration breaks the RLS down-test's hardcoded one-step rollback, and `guardPilotLabels` returns **nil** for an empty target → `{"labels":null}` for the `pilot`+`pilot-blocked` card, i.e. every stalled issue · PR#222 B7 sleep redo = D1–D4 all genuinely fixed (window logic survived off-by-one/sign/clock/missing-key attacks) but the exec reader polls project-scoped `/api/v1/queue` while the tenant unit omits `--dashboard-scope` and console renders multi-repo → **blind to every repo but #0**, and the PR closes the nil-reader escape hatch with no kill switch. **PR#221/#222 converted to DRAFT** to block auto-merge (note: this gates #216/#219, which carry `Depends on: #215`). **Two systemic holes found**: (1) **[#5233] a PR whose CI never ran resolves to `CISuccess` and auto-merges** — zero check-runs → grace expiry → combined-status `TotalCount==0` → success (and a status-lookup *error* also returns success); PR#221 sat 70min with zero runs while siblings had three, and it is red underneath — the draft is what stopped a false-green merge. (2) **[#5232] model refusals masquerade as `unknown: exit status 1`** — infra GH-33/34/35 were **declined** (`stop_reason: refusal`, `category: cyber`), visible only in the stream recording; being deterministic they trip the streak threshold and silently stall. Refiling with #31's authorization framing restored did NOT help — **stopped rather than reword a third time**; the harness needs a human or an authorized path (infra#35 unlabeled with 3 options). **S4 exit blocker CORRECTED by nav-research**: NOT the domain purchase — the dashboard proxy is a private-IP:9090 call a laptop cannot reach (all SSM-mediated paths *do* work locally, which is why S3 passed and why `observed=running` is not proof); pen test is **S5's** gate, not S4's; cheapest unblock = minimal in-VPC EC2 console, no ALB/ACM/SES/domain (~$15/mo) — **founder decision open**. Ops: infra root held a superseded PR#27 draft (stashed, root clean) · a manual `pilot-blocked` strip **bypasses** the #5215 re-arm probe (close+refile is the recovery) · estate cost Aug 1–26 = **$1,072**, ~$120/mo of it an idle SaaS control plane serving nothing · Jira token exposed in-session (founder: rotating all soon) · 3rd external contributor (stevensommer) #5227/#5228 vetted 08-27 — see top entry. Navigator plugin template injection-headers fixed upstream (`bdc0e87`). **Late-afternoon: ALL of the day's CI anomalies resolved to ONE root cause — a GitHub Actions MAJOR OUTAGE from 15:11:58Z** (githubstatus incident, still investigating at day close). PR#5231's run "completed with `failure`" at 15:16 while **all 8 jobs sat `queued` and never started**; autopilot burned its 30m `waiting_ci` budget at `last_status=pending` → `StageFailed`. Same cause: PR#221's 70min of zero runs, PR#218's `startup_failure`. **The code was never at fault — re-run when Actions is stable.** **[#5236] The platform-outage breaker did NOT trip** despite `platform_breaker.enabled: true` in prod: `platformBreaker.Observe` is fed only from the CI-**failure** path, but an outage produces work that *never runs* — the CI-timeout path sets `StageFailed` directly without calling `Observe`, and a zero-check SHA never reaches it. So an outage has **two shapes and we are unprotected against both**: checks never appear → treated green → merged (#5233); checks appear then time out → PR failed as if the code were broken. Good news: **PR#5235 (the #5233 fix) merged legitimately at 17:38 with all 8 checks genuinely green** — Actions is recovering intermittently. PR#5234 (refusal classification) merged + **reviewed APPROVE** — verified its parser against the real captured payload (`stop_details` nests *inside* `delta`), and the implementer caught something unspecified: `declined` is non-terminal in `HasTerminalCompletion`, so a second gauntlet check was needed or `nextRetryGeneration` would loop forever.

Auto-init: **#5216→PR#5219** (knowledge tree + graph.json seed, FEATURE-MATRIX `## Core Execution` anchor, injection headers in embedded template, numeric version compare — review APPROVE-w-defect: plugin-template precedence bypassed it on plugin-bearing machines incl. the box, CI green only because runners lack the cache) → **#5221→PR#5224** (`ensureContextSections` post-copy invariant + HOME-isolated tests + fabricated-cache regression test — APPROVE, verified on the plugin-bearing laptop). Incident en route: #5221 held 12+ cycles by the referenced-path gate over a *backticked fabricated fixture path* → **SOP Rule 3b** (backtick only paths that exist on main) + mem-178; session lessons mem-179. Fixes ride the next train (merged post-14:00Z v2.269.0 cut). Upstream CLOSED 08-26: plugin template seeded with the 3 injection headers (alekspetrov/navigator `bdc0e87`). Marker: `2026-08-25_autoinit-contract-docs-truth-session.md`.
- **08-18 (day): one external Jira bug → 7 defects fixed across 3 repos + Jira Cloud e2e LIVE-VALIDATED.** Morning: founder redefined S3 (memory `no-stripe-local-first-s3-testing` — no Stripe/Montenegro, no domain, local-first; infra PR#25 deploy deferred); local console stack refreshed (:8090 + :5173). #4917 (external, MattiaFailla) root-caused → #4929 epic — which **mis-decomposed into 8 children** (bare `no-decompose` token unmatched; pitfall memory updated ×2) surfacing a defect zoo, ALL fixed same day by Pilot: #4938 bare-token phrase (PR#4947) · #4944 closed-child-fails-run (PR#4949) · #4946 flaky `TestNewController_LogsResolvedReleasePolicy` killed green PR#4943 → flake recovery recipe (restore branch ref → reopen → rerun → merge) · #4927 PR-CI lint blind spot (PR#4928, <1h). Then **live-fire validation against a real Jira Cloud site falsified the fix**: the poller runs the **SDK client** (`cmd/pilot/poller_jira.go` → studio-sdk), not `internal/adapters/jira` — reporter's exact error reproduced on the patched binary (pitfall `jira-two-parallel-clients-poller-is-sdk`). Port sdk#119 → PR#120 Pilot-fixed in ~40min; sdk train then cut **v0.34.2 BELOW existing v0.35.0** (releaser baseline ignores tags it didn't create → #4953 filed+queued; corrective founder tag **v0.35.1**) → pin bump #4952 → PR#4954 → box rebuild → **JIRA-KAN-6 picked up, parsed (rich ADF), executed 56s/$0.21 → PR#4955** — full tracker-to-PR chain proven; every code change in it Pilot-authored. Also: #4265 closed (stale), #4932-class supersede gate = `pilot-superseded` label, root repo survived a `core.bare=true` flip from a SIGTERM-killed pre-push gate.

Detail: git log + `tasks/archive/`.

**Caveat CLEARED 2026-08-26 (was wrong since at least v2.149.4):** the long-standing claim that `gateway.Config.LinearWebhookPublicKey` has no YAML decode is **false** — nav-research verified it is fully wired: `internal/adapters/linear/types.go:20` (`yaml:"webhook_public_key"`) → `internal/pilot/linear_key.go` (PEM/PKIX/Ed25519 parse) → `internal/pilot/pilot.go:492` → `internal/gateway/server.go:126`, with the disabled-path logged at `pilot.go:495`. Ed25519 verification works when the key is configured. The real incident of this shape was **`gateway.Config.Auth` (GH-4784)** — validated + defaulted but both production constructors called the auth-less `NewServer` (memory `unwired-config-field-validated-but-dead`). This entry sat stale for months and was repeated as fact; do not reinstate it without re-grepping.

### Autopilot Environments (v1.59.0+)

The `--env` flag selects a deployment pipeline:

| Flag | CI Wait | Approval | Post-Merge | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| `dev` | Skip | No | none | Fast iteration, trust the bot |
| `stage` | Yes | No | none | CI must pass, then auto-merge |
| `prod` | Yes | Yes | tag | CI + human approval required |

```bash
pilot start --env=stage --telegram --github  # Balanced (recommended)
```

## 🚀 Pilot Cloud SaaS Program (TASK-405) — ACTIVE

Building the hosted Pilot SaaS using this daemon to build it (Pilot ships its own SaaS via `pilot`-labeled issues).

- **Plan of record + live status**: [`system/saas-roadmap.md`](system/saas-roadmap.md) (v9.9) — S0 ✅ · S1 ✅ · S2 ✅ (exit met 07-27) · H1–H12 ✅ · R-track ✅ · S6-lite ✅ · **S3 BUILT** (exit gated on founder staging inputs → operator deploy per infra PR#25) · **S4 board: waves 1+2 merged** (C1/C2/C7/C3/C4 + kanban UI) · **wave 3 + UI wave COMPLETE 08-05** (C5 · C6 · C8+fixes · C9 · ui#44/45 · TASK-448 metrics+PR#4739/4741 fixes) · **wave 4 in flight 08-06** (C15 PR#108 ✅ · pilot#4748 C14-pilot + #4749 events endpoint queued · C14-console + timeline legs gated on those merging · close verb dropped as already-built)
- **Program doc**: [`tasks/TASK-405-pilot-saas-platform.md`](tasks/TASK-405-pilot-saas-platform.md)
- **Design**: [`system/saas-architecture.md`](system/saas-architecture.md) · [`saas-kanban-sync-design.md`](system/saas-kanban-sync-design.md) · [`saas-fleet-design.md`](system/saas-fleet-design.md) · [`saas-asset-research.md`](system/saas-asset-research.md)
- **New repos** (created 2026-07-14, in `~/.pilot/config.yaml`): `qf-studio/pilot-console` (Go control plane) · `pilot-console-ui` (Vue3/Vite/Bun SPA) · `pilot-cloud-infra` (Go CDK) — each has its own `CLAUDE.md`
- **Latest handoff marker**: `.agent/.context-markers/2026-08-06_wave4-inflight-gauges-live-compact-ready.md`
- **Systemic**: TASK-407 atomic dispatch-admission claim — **proven + archived 2026-07-30** ([`tasks/archive/`](tasks/archive/TASK-407-dispatch-admission-claim.md); #4265 closed, `duplicate-pr` green since 07-24). TASK-406 shipped → archived.
- **Ops SOP**: [`sops/operations/safe-daemon-restart.md`](sops/operations/safe-daemon-restart.md) — restart is the operator's action; never relaunch the `--dashboard` daemon from an assistant shell (no single-instance lock yet)
- **Quality SOP**: [`sops/quality/real-stack-verify-gates-ui-merges.md`](sops/quality/real-stack-verify-gates-ui-merges.md) — ADOPTED 2026-07-30: UI-surface merges aren't DONE until operator-verified on the live local stack (daemon gates are fixture-only; 5 drift defects in one night prove it)
- **Incident**: [`system/incident-duplicate-cifix-2026-07-14.md`](system/incident-duplicate-cifix-2026-07-14.md) — the Hardening-track root cause

| **P1** | **Console rail implementation** ([TASK-478](tasks/TASK-478-console-rail-implementation.md)) | 11 approved designs → shipped surfaces. **Build-out COMPLETE 08-15 (overnight run): all 16 autopilotable legs executed + reviewed.** Blocked on founder morning sequence (approve PR#67→72→74→76 · close #73/#77 to arm retries · label ui#78 after) → then GH-69/GH-75 retries re-land · **real-stack verify batch UI-2..12** (SOP; blocked on GH-75 re-land) · CON-5 billing portal (founder Stripe gate) · copy pass ($299 · PR#72 "Includes" line · support@ mailto). Daemon-side follow-ups FILED 2026-08-20: [pilot#5027](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5027) merge-time ancestry check (stacked-superset guard, extends GH-4872) + [pilot#5028](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5028) base-presence check before claim (see pitfall `sequential-gates-on-execution-not-merge-fastfollow-misbase`; 4 family incidents in 6 days, nav-research verdict: both fixes needed). |
| **P1** | **Throughput acceleration** ([TASK-393](tasks/TASK-393-throughput-acceleration.md)) | Phase 1 (instrumentation) ✅ shipped 07-09. **M3 baseline window closed ~07-20 — histograms never harvested; phases 2–5 remain gated on that analysis.** Remaining: (2) execution lanes on `Complexity`, (3) N-concurrent per repo (`ProjectWorker` pool — note this is also the sole serialization point, see mem-101/102), (4) SHA-keyed repo primer, (5) risk-score trust tiers. Roadmap: [`throughput-roadmap.md`](system/throughput-roadmap.md) (M0–M8, D1–D6). |
| **P1** | **Execution lifecycle chokepoint** ([TASK-404](tasks/TASK-404-execution-lifecycle-chokepoint.md)) | B1 shipped (#4243 — `ExecutionLifecycle` Begin/Transition/Finish + typed status vocabulary). Remaining legs open; #4678's cancel verb lands on this seam. |
| **P1** | **Hosted retry path for failed executions** ([TASK-485](tasks/TASK-485-hosted-retry-path-failed-executions.md), [#5008](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/5008)) | Daemon legs SHIPPED+REVIEWED 08-25 (PR#5214 classifier · PR#5215 stalled re-arm sweep · PR#5220 streak alert) — ride the 08-26 v2.270.0 train. **Remaining: Leg 3** (console repo: C8 dispatch on failed/stalled card cycles trigger label + removes `pilot-blocked`) **after the train lands on the box**, then **Phase 4** live validation on ship-test-js#6 (expect ≤16min re-arm latency — repick backoff gate). |
| — | ~~Wire `linear.webhook_public_key` YAML~~ | **REMOVED 2026-08-26 — the premise was false.** Verified fully wired end-to-end (see the cleared caveat above). Nothing to do. |
| P1 | Fix `shouldTriggerRelease()` | Doesn't check `ResolvedEnv().Release` — only top-level config. |
| P1 | Web dashboard polish | React UI functional but needs a design pass. |
| **P1** | **Jira merge-side close: reachability chain** ([#4999](https://github.com/qf-studio/pilot/issues/4999) + sdk#123/#124 + sdk PR#122 tag/pin) | PR#4992 merged the done leg but it's **dead code in production** (TASK-460 class — pitfall `merged-feature-dead-callback-not-bridged-onprcreated`): sdk jira adapter drops `OnPRCreated`, reconciler adopts only `pilot/GH-*`, external-merge path (how KAN-6's PR actually merged) never calls it, and pinned sdk v0.35.1 does English-name transitions + comment-first-early-return. Chain to close: sdk#123 (bridge OnPRCreated, all tracker adapters) · sdk#124 (statusCategory transitions + decouple from comment failure) · #4999 (external-merge leg + idempotency) · sdk v0.35.2 tag + pin bump (ADF comment fix #122 is merged-untagged). KAN-6 acceptance (card leaves «К выполнению») transfers to #4999. |
| P2 | Delivery-evidence audit — false-success class ([TASK-460](tasks/TASK-460-delivery-evidence-false-success.md)) | Split from TASK-459 by founder scope call 08-08: green CI is not proof the requested change shipped (`mem-151`: scaffold-only PR merged green, parent auto-closed, zero requirements delivered). Planned, NOT dispatched; TASK-459 Phase 4's inventory hook feeds it the success-side site rows. Candidate legs: diff-surface check · ACs fail-when-unwired · epic-collapse guard. |
| P2 | E2E test suite | No integration tests — reliability untested. |
| P2 | Web dashboard auth | Token-based auth for remote access. |
| P2 | Mobile-responsive dashboard | Primary use case is phone access. |
| P3 | GitHub App auth | PAT → installable GitHub App. |
| P3 | Audit §3 Wave 4+ candidates | Not yet decomposed: `RecordAPIError` wiring beyond github · `AlertTypeOOMKilled` · multi-gate scanner phase discipline · subprocess migration end-to-end validation · `autopilot` adapter coupling refactor · SQL `withTx` helper · generic `Poller[T]` extraction · `Releaser` frozen-at-startup fix.

**Operator-parked (not autopilotable):** **domain pick** (`pilot.build` premium $720/yr · `pilot.engineering` $83 · `pilothq.dev` ~$15; = OIDC issuer, sticky) · **box roots corrupted** (`pilot-console` staged −40k lines since 07-29 11:44, `pilot-console-ui` 158 files since 07-29 18:28 — forensics-vs-reset is a founder call; do NOT reset from an assistant shell) · branch protection on `qf-studio/pilot` main (TASK-405 founder decision 7 — main is currently unprotected) · EBS restore DRILL (runbook exists at pilot-cloud-infra `docs/RESTORE-RUNBOOK.md`; the drill itself is operator work) · tenant box `i-0a3bf271d598196ca` still on **2.259.3** (predates TASK-485 daemon legs — fleet images are immutable by invariant, rolling-upgrade machinery is console#216; operator binary swap is the interim for Phase 4) · rotate ALL box tracker/API tokens (founder-planned; Jira token exposed in a 08-26 session) · infra#2 Golden AMI v2 (stale claim corrected 08-26: `aws-infrastructure-pilot` IS in the box config — issue itself needs re-triage) · console#45 (`pilot-spec-incomplete`/`blocked` since 07-24 — needs rewriting into an implementable spec).

## Development Workflow

**Default: release then upgrade — don't run ad-hoc local builds.**

```bash
make test
make fmt && make lint
```

**Cycle-gated exception (2026-07-10):** to run merged-but-unreleased `main`
on the daemon *without* cutting a release (release cycles hold work for the
16:00 train), build from a **detached worktree at `origin/main`** and install
to the daemon's path — NOT the root, NOT `make install` (~/go/bin), NOT brew:

```bash
git worktree add --detach /tmp/pilot-build origin/main
cd /tmp/pilot-build && make build          # bin/pilot, version stamped from git describe
cp -p ~/.local/bin/pilot ~/.local/bin/pilot.bak-<rev>   # rollback
cp bin/pilot ~/.local/bin/pilot            # daemon runs ~/.local/bin/pilot (mem: binary path)
git worktree remove --force /tmp/pilot-build
# restart daemon in the zellij `pilot` pane: pilot start --dashboard --github --telegram --tunnel --replace
```

Config is external (`~/.pilot/config.yaml`) — the new binary shares it
unchanged. Building never releases (release = tag push only). Verify the
running binary with `go version -m ~/.local/bin/pilot | grep -E 'main.version|vcs'`.

## Release Workflow

```bash
# Tag-only: GoReleaser CI handles the rest
git tag v0.X.Y && git push origin v0.X.Y

# Upgrade to new version
pilot upgrade
```

**Fresh Install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qf-studio/pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Known Issue (GH-204):** Install script doesn't auto-configure PATH. Users must add `~/.local/bin` to PATH or open new terminal.

## Configuration

Copy `configs/pilot.example.yaml` to `~/.pilot/config.yaml`.

Key per-adapter env vars:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub polling + PR creation
- `LINEAR_API_KEY` - Linear webhook adapter
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Slack Socket Mode adapter
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram adapter

## CLI Flags

### `pilot start`
- `--env=ENV` - Enable autopilot mode: `dev`, `stage`, `prod`
- `--dashboard` - Launch TUI dashboard with live task monitoring
- `--telegram` - Enable Telegram polling
- `--github` - Enable GitHub polling
- `--slack` - Enable Slack Socket Mode
- `--daemon` - Run in background
- `--sequential` - Wait for PR merge before next issue (default)

## Documentation Loading Strategy

1. **Every session**: This file
2. **Feature work**: Task doc in `.agent/tasks/`
3. **Architecture changes**: `.agent/system/ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. **Integration work**: Relevant adapter code
